  --shared-dir      colon-separated options for configuring a directory to be   
                    shared with the VM. The first field is the directory to be  
                    shared and the second field is the tag that the VM can use  
                    to identify the device. The remaining fields are key=value  
                    pairs that may appear in any order.                         
                     Valid keys are:                                            
                        type=(p9, fs) - Indicates whether the directory should  
                           be shared via virtio-9p or virtio-fs (default: p9).  
                        uidmap=UIDMAP - The uid map to use for the device's     
                           jail in the format "inner outer                      
                           count[,inner outer count]"                           
                           (default: 0 <current euid> 1).                       
                        gidmap=GIDMAP - The gid map to use for the device's     
                           jail in the format "inner outer                      
                           count[,inner outer count]"                           
                           (default: 0 <current egid> 1).                       
                        cache=(never, auto, always) - Indicates whether the VM  
                           can cache the contents of the shared directory       
                           (default: auto).  When set to "auto" and the type    
                           is "fs", the VM will use close-to-open consistency   
                           for file contents.                                   
                        timeout=SECONDS - How long the VM should consider file  
                           attributes and directory entries to be valid         
                           (default: 5).  If the VM has exclusive access to the 
                           directory, then this should be a large value.  If    
                           the directory can be modified by other processes,    
                           then this should be 0.                               
                        writeback=BOOL - Enables writeback caching              
                           (default: false).  This is only safe to do when the  
                           VM has exclusive access to the files in a directory. 
                           Additionally, the server should have read            
                           permission for all files as the VM may issue read    
                           requests even for files that are opened write-only.  
                        dax=BOOL - Enables DAX support.  Enabling DAX can       
                           improve performance for frequently accessed files    
                           by mapping regions of the file directly into the     
                           VM's memory. There is a cost of slightly increased   
                           latency the first time the file is accessed.  Since  
                           the mapping is shared directly from the host kernel's
                           file cache, enabling DAX can improve performance even
                            when the guest cache policy is "Never".  The default
                            value for this option is "false".                   
                        posix_acl=BOOL - Indicates whether the shared directory 
                           supports POSIX ACLs.  This should only be enabled    
                           when the underlying file system supports POSIX ACLs. 
                           The default value for this option is "true".         
                        uid=UID - uid of the device process in the user         
                           namespace created by minijail. (default: 0)          
                        gid=GID - gid of the device process in the user         
                           namespace created by minijail. (default: 0)          
                        Options uid and gid are useful when the crosvm process  
                        has no CAP_SETGID/CAP_SETUID but an identity mapping of 
                        the current user/group between the VM and the host is   
                        required. Say the current user and the crosvm process   
                        has uid 5000, a user can use "uid=5000" and             
                        "uidmap=5000 5000 1" such that files owned by user      
                        5000 still appear to be owned by user 5000 in the VM.   
                        These 2 options are useful only when there is 1 user    
                        in the VM accessing shared files. If multiple users     
                        want to access the shared file, gid/uid options are     
                        useless. It'd be better to create a new user namespace  
                        and give CAP_SETUID/CAP_SETGID to the crosvm.
